"""
Example of classes that we already know.
OOP (Object Oriented Programming): programming with "objects". Objects
are nothing other than a single copy of a class with specific data
inside. The single copy, because we're annoying programmers, is called
an 'instance' of the class.

A class is the combined definition of some data and some specific 
functions.

a = 'Duquesne'
a.find('Duq')

class String:
    # Init is the first function run and it's a stupid name that no
    # one would accidentally use
    def __init__(self):
        # self is the name of the specific copy of the data/class
        # otherwise known as the instance of the class

        self.content = new_content
